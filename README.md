Node REST
===
Quick setup REST server with admin interface for more intuitive data manipulation.

Get it as a node module `npm install mean-street`
You may have to `bower_install` inside `app/`

=OR=

Make sure to run `npm install` to get all the dependencies.
Make sure you run `bower install` inside of the `/app` folder

Run `gulp [, --port 3000, --secret MadeUpSecretKeyGoesHere --database ``{"name": "myNewTestDatabaseName"}``, --env dev, ]` and the server is set up!
For more available flags check `config/config.json` for the `flags` parameter

To setup admin, go to `/signup`. Signup with your custom username / password then edit the
entry to have `"admin" : true` for admin privileges

    `bin/solr start` ( you may need to chmod 775 bin/solr ) and run it via `./solr start`
    `bin/solr create -c <coreName>`` ( if this does not work than try ``./solr create -c <coreName>`
