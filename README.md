Node REST
===
Quick setup REST server with admin interface for more intuitive data manipulation.

Get it as a node module `npm install mean-street`

=OR=

Make sure to run `npm install` to get all the dependencies.
Make sure you run `bower install` inside of the `/app` folder

Run `node server.js --secret MadeUpSecretKeyGoesHere [,--database databasePath, --port 3000, --baseUrl rest, --env dev, ]` and the server is set up!

To setup admin, go to `/signup`. Signup with your custom username / password then edit the
entry to have `"admin" : true` for admin privileges
